Scale and proportion matter as much as the design of at the chandeliers itself, and ultimately you’ll be seeking a harmonious interior composition in which all the separate components create a visually striking and supremely functional space. Beyond the obvious—chandeliers that are so big that they overwhelm a room, or ones too small to create the desired impact in large spaces—it’s only when considered in context, that the size of your modern chandelier will produce the kind of lighting statement that you’re after. You’ll also want to consider the shape of the chandelier. Modern chandeliers come in many shapes including <a href=\"\/collections\/round-chandeliers\">round<\/a>, <a href=\"\/collections\/globe-chandeliers\">globe<\/a>, <a href=\"\/collections\/diamond-chandeliers\">diamond<\/a>, <a href=\"\/collections\/oval-chandeliers\">oval<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/collections\/teardrop-chandeliers\">teardrop<\/a>."

So, rather than thinking of chandeliers in traditional terms, think of them as modern lighting suited to any room in a home—just on a larger scale. Chandeliers can accommodate an array of styles such as mid century modern, Scandinavian, farmhouse, and <a href=\"\/collections\/french-country-chandeliers\">French Country<\/a>."

Substantially sized and meant to be attention getters, chandeliers are the very definition of statement lighting—and, because of their larger size, present design challenges of their own.<\/p>\n        <p>Whether perfectly suited or ill-chosen, a modern chandelier, which is typically larger than most modern lighting designs, naturally has a more significant impact on a room than other types of smaller scale modern lighting—so choosing the right modern chandelier for a room or space demands particularly thoughtful consideration.
